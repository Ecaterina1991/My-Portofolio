          I grew up loving beauty in all its forms and having an innate
          intuition for harmony. In every project I put passion, finding the
          middle key between what the user wants and the best form of
          presentation in the world of Web Development and Web Design.

          I initially pursued a career in pharmacy, but my love for technology
          and the beauty led me to explore the world of web development and
          design, which allows me to combine my passion for creating visually
          appealing designs with my desire to improve the way people interact
          with technology. To further develop my skills, I completed the Google
          IT Support Specialist and Google UX Designer courses, and now I am
          excited to apply my knowledge to real-world projects. In addition to
          my passion for technology, I am also an avid painter, a lover of
          literature and swimming. I believe that my diverse interests and
          background have helped me develop a unique perspective that I bring to
          my work. I am always looking for ways to improve and evolve as a
          designer. Thank you for visiting! I hope my portfolio provides a
          glimpse into my approach to design and the value I can bring to your
          project.
